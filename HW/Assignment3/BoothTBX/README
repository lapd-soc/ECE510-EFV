To compile for PureSim mode 

make puresim 

To compile for Veloce mode

make veloce 

To launch the simulation 

vsim -novopt top booth_hvl TbxSvManager +RUNS=<NumberofTests> +SIGNS=<SignsofOperands>

NumberofTests = Number of test cases you'd like to generate
SignsofOperands = Signs of multiplicand and multiplier you;d like

e.g.
vsim -novopt top booth_hvl TbxSvManager +RUNS=50 +SINGS=+-

The above command launches simulation and generates 50 test cases where Multiplicand is 
Positive (+) and Multiplier is Negative (-)
