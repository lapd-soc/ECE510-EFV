Assignment 5
Due Thurs, before June 4 class
Given the following sequence, for each formula, determine if it is true or false.
a) □¬(x=0 /\ y=0)
	false
b) □[x=0 ⇒ y’=0]x,y
	true
c) ◊(x=7 /\ y=0)
	true
d) ◊<y=0 /\ x’=0>y
	false
e) □◊(y ≠ 0)
	false
f) ◊□ (x=0 ⇒ y≠0)
	false
g) ◊□[FALSE]y -> [X]<v> = X \/ (v' = v)
	true

	
Not to be turned in (from previous exams)
1) Consider the following trace sequence:
Which of the following formulas hold for the behavior above? Explain your reasoning.
	a) □ ¬ ( x=3 /\ y’=0 )
		false - it cannot at any time be that x=3 and y'=0, but times c/d
	b) □◊( x+y >2 )
		false - it always be an eventuality that x+y > 2, but x:always = 1, y:always=0
	c) ◊< x=1 /\ y’=3 >x
		false - it is an eventuality that x=1 and y'=3 where x changes from x!=1 to x=1, but g/h
	
2) Consider a system with two processors and a shared memory. During execution of CISC instructions,
each processor occasionally requires exclusive access to the memory to read values and possibly
update the memory. To model the system, consider a game with 2 players who compete for a coin.
Upon getting the coin, the player flips the coin. If the coin lands heads-up, the player increments a
counter. The coin then is released and the players compete for the coin again. When one of the
players has gotten 10 heads, the game restarts.
Write a specification using TLA+ that includes separate actions for getting the coin and flipping the
coin. Think first. Then write an outline on this page of the structure of your specification (leaving lots
of room to then fill in the details ). Use auxiliary definitions. Exact syntax isn't critical, but will
receive a bonus.




3) Are the following specs Next1 and Next2 equivalent? Explain your reasoning.
	Next1 == \/ /\ b = 0 	Next2 == b' = IF b = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0
			    /\ b' = 1
			 \/ /\ b = 1
				/\ b' = 0
